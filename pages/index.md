title: DataViz for Indian Cities
---

I started this project with Pimpri Chinchwad but am open to data submissions from other cities as well. 

# Tools: 
- [Evidence](https://docs.evidence.dev/) as the static site generator
- [gmft](https://github.com/conjuncts/gmft) to extract tables from old PDF reports from city agencies. You can find the script [here](https://github.com/micahchoo/Jenga-Block-Archiving-Tools/tree/main/Extract%20tables%20from%20PDFs)
- [RKward](https://github.com/KDE/rkward) to transform data from the reports into something usable

# Content Plan
- Clean up content in pieces
- Add PMPML per depot data as published by PMPML's Chief Statistician as a dynamic data source updated every month
- Add https://pcpc.gov.in/ncrb crime data per month
- https://www.pcmcindia.gov.in/financial_L2_E.php per year
