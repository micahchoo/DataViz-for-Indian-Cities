1. A brief description of what this table contains:

This table appears to be tracking the growth of urban sprawl over three different time periods (1989, 2000, and 2007) using satellite imagery data from different sources (TM Image, ETM Image, and Google Image). It shows the area in square kilometers, as well as the increase in area and percentage increase between each stage.

a. The area under consideration experienced significant growth, increasing by approximately 18.99% between 1989 and 2000, and then by a staggering 84.68% between 2000 and 2007.
b. The data sources used for measuring the area changed over time, potentially introducing inconsistencies or differences in measurement methodologies.
