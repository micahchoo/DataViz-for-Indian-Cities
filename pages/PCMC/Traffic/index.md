title: Traffic Volume Surveys
description: Vehicle traffic measured at key locations across PCMC (2008) and the wider Pune metro (2021)

Two traffic surveys, thirteen years apart, capture how vehicle volumes shifted across Pimpri-Chinchwad and the wider Pune metropolitan area.

## 2008: PCMC Baseline

The [2008 Comprehensive Mobility Plan survey](/PCMC/Traffic/Pimpri_Chinchwad_Traffic_at_Locations) measured traffic at 15 locations across PCMC. It established key patterns: NH-4 corridor dominance (Dapodi Bridge at 1.2 lakh vehicles/day), two-wheeler dominance on internal roads (50-54% share), and sparse traffic on the northern periphery (Dehu-Alandi at under 10,000 vehicles/day).

## 2021: Metro-Wide Update

The [2021 Metro DPR traffic survey](/PCMC/Traffic/Pimpri_Chinchwad_Traffic_at_Locations_2021) expanded coverage to 82 locations across PMC, PCMC, and outlying areas. The PCU/Vehicle ratio at each point reveals the vehicle mix — ratios below 0.85 indicate two-wheeler dominant traffic, while ratios above 1.1 indicate heavy vehicle corridors.

## What Changed

Four locations can be matched between the two surveys. The results suggest traffic redistribution rather than uniform growth:

- **Dapodi Bridge: -58%** — NH-4 traffic dispersed to parallel routes
- **Harris Bridge (Bopodi): +265%** — absorbed traffic displaced from Dapodi
- **Aundh Bridge: +31%** — moderate growth on the Aundh-Ravet corridor
- **Nashik Phata: +65%** — reflects development of PCMC's northern corridor

The pattern is clear: the city's traffic arteries shifted. The once-dominant Dapodi Bridge corridor lost traffic to a wider network of crossings, while PCMC's expanding northern periphery grew substantially.
